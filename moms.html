    <p>Surrounded by a sorority quad full of Greek life, twelve women live between Emerson St. and University Place, within the chapter houses but outside of Panhellenic membership. House directors, or “house moms,” as they are more commonly known, are live-in employees of the chapter house corporations. They exist somewhere between business directors and guardians, each tailoring their duties to fit their personalities. Many of these women spend time together, gathering on the front stoops in their free time, but the rest of campus rarely sees them. Within their respective houses and without, each “house mom” retains her own style of leadership and distinctive personal life. NBN talked to three of these women in a project inspired by the New York Times’ <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/nyregion/1-in-8-million/index.html">“One in 8 Million”</a> project.</p>
